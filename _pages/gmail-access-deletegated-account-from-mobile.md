Instead of sharing password of your gmail account, you can easilty setup email delegation by which the delegated user can access same email account with his primary gmail login. 

Refer [How to Set up mail delegation in Gmail](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/138350?hl=en).

By default, delegated account will not be able to access from mobile apps but you can achive this using a mobile browser. 

### Open gmail.com in Chrome or Firefox

Tap on Setting bar on left top.
