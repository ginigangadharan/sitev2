## Introduction - AI, ML, DL, and GenAI

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The broader field of creating intelligent agents, aiming to mimic human intelligence.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI focused on teaching computers to learn from data without explicit programming.
- **Deep Learning (DL)**: A subset of ML using artificial neural networks to analyze complex patterns in data.
- **Generative AI (Gen AI)**: A subfield focused on creating new content, such as text, images, or code, based on learned patterns.

**[InstructLab](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/ai/what-is-instructlab)** is a game-changer for enhancing large language models (LLMs). This open-source project, co-created by IBM and Red Hat, makes it easier to align LLMs with user intent, opening up possibilities for innovative AI applications.

**[Podman AI Lab](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/ai-lab)** is Red Hat's answer to simplifying the AI development process. This extension provides a local environment with essential open-source tools and curated recipes to guide you through building AI solutions.

**[Red Hat OpenShift AI](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/openshift-ai)** is a powerful platform for deploying and scaling AI applications across hybrid cloud environments. Built on open-source technologies, it offers a trusted foundation for teams to experiment, serve models, and deliver innovative AI-driven apps.

### AI Knowledge vs Skill

**Knowledge in AI:**

- Knowledge represents the information and data that an AI system has access to, including facts, rules, and concepts about the world or a specific domain. It's the foundational material that the AI uses to make decisions, predictions, and perform tasks.
- AI systems accumulate knowledge through data training (e.g., large datasets of text, images, or structured data) and can retrieve and apply this knowledge when required.
- Knowledge can be encoded as rules (in rule-based systems) or derived from patterns in data (in machine learning systems).

**Examples:**

- A language model like GPT is trained on vast amounts of text data, providing it with knowledge about grammar, facts, and even context.
- A medical diagnostic AI might have knowledge about symptoms, diseases, and treatments stored in its database or learned from medical literature.

**Skill in AI:**

- Skill refers to the ability of an AI to apply knowledge effectively to perform tasks or solve problems. It involves leveraging knowledge in a way that demonstrates proficiency in a specific task or set of tasks.
- AI develops skills through training, experience, and fine-tuning. Skill in AI can be thought of as the execution part, where the system demonstrates its capability to solve real-world problems using the knowledge it possesses.

**Examples:**

- A self-driving car's ability to navigate roads by understanding traffic rules and reacting to real-time conditions.
- A machine learning model's skill to recognize objects in images, using knowledge about how certain objects appear.

**Relationship Between Knowledge and Skill in AI:**

- Knowledge is the foundation, while skill is the application of that knowledge.
- An AI system may have vast knowledge but limited skill if it cannot effectively use the information to solve tasks.
- Conversely, a highly skilled AI must be backed by a strong knowledge base to perform its tasks accurately and consistently.
