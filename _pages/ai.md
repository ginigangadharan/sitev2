## Introduction

**[InstructLab](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/ai/what-is-instructlab)** is a game-changer for enhancing large language models (LLMs). This open-source project, co-created by IBM and Red Hat, makes it easier to align LLMs with user intent, opening up possibilities for innovative AI applications.

**[Podman AI Lab](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/ai-lab)** is Red Hat's answer to simplifying the AI development process. This extension provides a local environment with essential open-source tools and curated recipes to guide you through building AI solutions.

**[Red Hat OpenShift AI](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/openshift-ai)** is a powerful platform for deploying and scaling AI applications across hybrid cloud environments. Built on open-source technologies, it offers a trusted foundation for teams to experiment, serve models, and deliver innovative AI-driven apps.
