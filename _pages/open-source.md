## Introduction

Open source refers to software where the source code is freely available for anyone to see, modify, and distribute. This fosters collaboration, innovation, and transparency. Open source projects often evolve into popular products through active community development and adoption. The following list explores some well-known open source projects and the products they have helped create.
