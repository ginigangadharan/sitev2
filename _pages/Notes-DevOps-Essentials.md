- Using a CI Server
- Multiple times a day
- feedback on merge and build

Why ?
- Easy to detect issue with smaller changes
- small releases instead of big releases
- continuous testing

### Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment
- code is always ready for deployment
- frequently deploying small code changes

- Automated deployment
- if issue, automatic roll back

- lower risk
- Reliable rollbacks

### Infrastructure As Code

- maintainable way

Why ?
