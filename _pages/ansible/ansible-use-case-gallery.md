## Immutable Infrastructure

- Configure your re-buildable replicas of server set or application stack.
- Use Ansible for **Infrastructure as Code** (IaC)

## Provisioning

Provision your bare-metal, private cloud and public cloud infrastructure using modules and configure them to use for day 2 operations.

### AWS 

- Instance Provisioning
- LoadBalancer /  TargetGroup Creation
- VPC Creation

## Application Deployment

Manage your applications deployments, re-deployments, migration using simple ansible playbooks; and implement DevSecOps methods in your infrastructure operations.

## Security Management

- Incident Response

## Manage network configurations

- Configure new network devices with same configurations as we need
- Add new rules or changes in configurations (eg: new VLAN, new Virtual Interface)
- Add/Remove rule in firewall

## Package Deployment

- [Windows Package Management](https://www.ansible.com/blog/windows-package-management)

## Operating System Patching

## Weekly system reboot

Eliminate repetitive, manual processes with automation.


## Enforce security guidelines
Rules are rules. Itâ€™s best to automate in an effort to achieve strict security standards.

## Configuration Management

Keep your configurations as a code and also can check if someone made chages to the same.

## Disaster recovery
Disaster recovery can involve a wide range of components. Act across different variables of the technology stack to identify problems and eliminate cross team dependencies.

## Adhoc Commands
Remarkably easy to write, you can run commands across your environment for any number of servers.

## Database

### Ansible Oracles Modules

- [ansible-oracle-modules](https://github.com/oravirt/ansible-oracle-modules)

### Database binary patching
Several databases use outdated binary sets. Patch the binaries in accordance with the release of the latest patch.

## Service license agreements

- Gather subscription information and generate reports.
- Auto reminder emails on subscription and license renewal
