Installing a module :

An excellent general guide to writing modules (I've no connection to the author) can be found here: http://blog.toast38coza.me/custom-ansible-module-hello-world/

The quickest way is to simply have a folder called library/ in the same folder as your playbook. Inside this folder, place the python script for the Ansible Module. You should now have a corresponding task available to your playbook.

If you want to share your module across multiple projects, then you can add an entry to /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg pointing to a shared library location, eg:

library        = /usr/share/ansible/library
