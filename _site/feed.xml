&lt;p&gt;I heard the same concern from a few friends recently, as they are already Certified as AWS Architects or DevOps engineers but never got a chance to work on AWS! But trust me, there are so many ways to get hands-on, you can do your own PoC’s and get more exposure on each and every technology. So the next question is, what should I do for the PoC ? what type of experiments I can try with my own arrangements ? Well, if you ask me this for AWS, there is a great collection of Hands-on Tutorials by AWS itself.
In August 2020, Red Hat announced the availability of Remote exams for students and the entire Learning community were so happy, yes we can attend Red Hat exams from our home or office; not all exams yet.&lt;/p&gt;

This is good in a way that Ansible developers don’t need to wait for a specific release cycle of Ansible to include their latest version of module or library; instead they can distribute their content and make available latest versions via Ansible Collections separately.&lt;/p&gt;

Oh.. then I realized that there are some misunderstanding about Ansible and it’s supported platforms as most of them thought Ansible is only available for Linux (or Unix); yes that is true (Ansible is not natively available for Windows yet) but you know, you can use Ansible to manage your Windows machines as well (and network devices, firewall devices, cloud, containers and more)&lt;/p&gt;
